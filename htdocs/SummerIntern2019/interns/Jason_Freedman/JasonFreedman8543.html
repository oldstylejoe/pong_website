<p>Hi, I'm Jason Freedman</p>
<p>I graduated from Chapman with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in game development. I have learned how to code in Python, Java, and C++. I also know how to code in the Unity program with C#. Additionally, I have worked with modeling programs such as Maya and Blender, although my experience in those is limited (I can make objects, but I can't make people).</p>

<h3>Python, Java, and C++</h3>
<p>I used Python as an introduction to Computer Science. I found it easy to learn and have recently brushed up on it (though it is not currently my strongest language).</p>
<p>I used Java for my intermediate work. Most of it involved creating programs to solve calculations.</p>
<p>I used C++ for my senior work. With it, I have done things like creating a program to go through a string of DNA nuceltides and return the matching string, a program that calculates how long a colony of bacteria will last in a simulated game, a simple pathfinding script, and a program to compare the speed of 3 of the sorting algorithms.</p>

<h3>Unity</h3>
<p>Most of the coursework for my minor involved programming with Unity</p>
<p>One of the projects I worked on was a team project called Insert Memory Here. The goal of the project was to create a memory game to help people with dementia or short-term memory loss. As this was a project done on a school computer, I don't have any pictures of it.</p>
<p>One project I worked on in my free time was a game where you could control the movement of a rolling ball on an endless track. The track would randomly generate each next part of the track from an array of road segments and would continue to generate a track until the player fell off the track, at which point the game would start over. The game also has an option to continuously decrease the spawn and de-spawn times of the track pieces.</p>

<h3>Maya and Blender</h3>
<p>I have some experience creating objects with Maya and Blender, although as previously mentioned, creating things in these programs was either a hobby or work for a class in my minor. Here are some examples of my work:</p>

<h3>Data Science</h3>
<p>I had a class at Chapman that focused exclusively on Data Science. This class mainly used SQL to create databases and the code to iterate through them. While I haven't used SQL in a while, I remember finding it easy to learn and easy to pick up if I needed to brush up on it.</p>

<h3>Virtual Reality Medical Center</h3>
<p>I currently have an internship at the Virtual Reality Medical Center to develop games to help children, adolescents, and young adults with important life skills and basic communication strategies.</p>

<h3>UCSD/PoNG Center</h3>
<p>From June 3rd to July 26th, I had an internship at the PoNG Center to develop a gamified version of one of their tests so as to make a version of the test that was more stimulating/interesting. I was in charge of creating the code for the game.</p>
