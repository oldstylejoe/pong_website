				<p>Currently only usable in and around UCSD, Sight Seekes is an
					Android application which contains various landmarks for the user
					to visit. The goal of the project was to create an application that
					helped the elderly, specifically those with dementia, retain their
					sense of direction and location</p>

				<p>Power is everything. It is what has driven you to learn the
					craft of wizardry; what has driven you to shun the limited
					teachings of Botanists, Thaumaturges and their ilk to create your
					own spells. You are only just now taking the first steps of this
					journey by studying this book you hold in your hands but, with
					dedication, you can become the master of these arts and break the
					chains on magic.</p>
				<p>There are some things to remember, however. Any search for
					power comes with dangers, and any climb to the top has perils. A
					cape has the potential to give abilities beyond your wildest
					dreams, but guard it well; if another practitioner takes it, they
					can hijack your gains for themselves. Mana will feed your abilities
					and provide clean, abundant energy; take on more than your body can
					handle, however, and you will pay for your greed.</p>
				<p>Finally, there is the Underworld. Dark creatures travel in
					that void, and the smallest misstep can cost you your life. The
					spirits there are slow and seem to pose little threat to a cautious
					adventurer, but once they have your scent you will find no shelter
					to hide from them, no wall to stop them. Unicorns may be beautiful
					– from a distance – but more than one wizard has perished on those
					sharp, spiral horns.</p>
				<p>All that is still to come, however, for now it is time to
					take your first steps.</p>
				<p>Good luck.</p>

				<p>Refraction is a mod that is based on the manipulation of
					light and lasers. You do so by making arrays of magnifiers to
					collect sunlight into focused beams or by making laser blocks that
					require glowstone. Light beams in this mod can be split and merged
					using half mirrors, prisms, and reflection chambers in order to
					produce different colors of light, and colors of light in the mod
					all have special effects that will ensure you no boredom ever. For
					example, a cyan light beam attracts any entities towards the source
					while a purple beam disperses entities away from the source.</p>
